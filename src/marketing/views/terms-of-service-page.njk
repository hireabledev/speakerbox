          You are now reading Speakerboxâ€™s Terms of Service, which is the agreement between you and Speakerbox when
          you use our website and other products and services. Please carefully read this as well as our
          <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> before you start using Speakerbox.
          We've tried to make it straightforward and fair for our users.
          If you have questions or suggestions, shoot us <a href="mailto:{{ LEGAL_EMAIL }}">an email<a>.
          We've also provided a few comments - these comments are not a part of the agreement,

        <p>
          This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions ("Terms of Service") which is a

          and the user (you!) will be referred to as "You" or the "User".
          By using our Products and Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
          If you do not agree with the Terms of Service or our Privacy Policy, you should not,

          Our Products and Services may change, which may include new functionality,

          Comment: Speakerbox is always changing and so we need some flexibility to get rid of things that you,
          the user don't like. Sometimes, we may get rid of something you did like but trust us,
          it's for the greater good. We may suspend accounts but we'll do our best to be fair and
          transparent about this.

        <p>
          Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in
          our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Contribution violates the
          Terms of Service, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity,
          threatens the personal safety of users of the Website or the public or could create liability for Speakerbox.

        <p>
          If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Â§1542, which says:
          "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to
          exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have
          materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
        </p>
        <p>
          THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

          damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
          arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Service or your use of
          the Products and Services, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions,
          any use of the content found on Speakerbox, or any other information other than as

          Termination
        </h2>
        <p>
          Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying the other party.
          Speakerbox may also terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use any and all
          Products and Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason,
          including but not limited to if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.

          specific products or services through Speakerbox and any User Contributions will immediately cease.
          All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall
          survive termination, including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers and limitations of
          liability. Termination of your access to and use of the Products and Services shall not
          relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any
          liability which you otherwise may have to Speakerbox or any third party.

        </h2>
        <p>
          No waiver of by Speakerbox of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Service shall be
          deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term
          or condition, and any failure of Speakerbox to assert a right or provision under these
          Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
          jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be
